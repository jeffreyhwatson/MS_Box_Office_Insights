    "![blueprint](images/blueprint.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository is like a blueprint, providing structure for your first End of Phase Project. We suggest you base your Phase 1 project off of this repository so you can focus less on formatting and organization, and more on the _analysis and communication skills_ that will support your progress through the course. This template is designed to make your project portfolio-ready in order to impress the future employers who will review it. \n",
    "\n",

    "   - In GitHub, go to this repository and click the \"Fork\" button in the upper right.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Change the name of your fork of this repo to a _descriptive_ name of your choosing\n",
    "   - In GitHub, go to your fork of this repo -> \"Settings\" -> \"Options\" -> \"Repository Name\" -> \"Rename\"\n",
    "   - Make the name descriptive, since potential employers will read it. Ex: \"Microsoft-Movie-Analysis\" is better than \"Project-1\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use `git clone` to clone your fork of this repo to your local computer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Work In Your Fork Of This Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work in the repo clone that you created on your local machine\n",
    "- Start writing and coding in the Jupyter Notebook `dsc-phase1-project-template.ipynb`\n",
    "- Fill in the README template in `TEMPLATE_README.md`\n",
    "- Use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` often to update your repo in GitHub\n",
    "   - For a refresher on how to do this and why it's important, review Topic 2: Bash and Git\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use The Slide Template\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PaiH1bleXnhiPjTPsAXQSiAK0nkaRlseQIr_Yb-0mz0/copy) to make an editable copy of the slide deck in your own Google Drive account\n",
    "2. Go to \"Slide,\" select \"Change Theme,\" and pick a theme you like so your presentation doesn't look like everyone else's\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidy Up Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change the file name of the Jupyter Notebook (`dsc-phase1-project-template.ipynb`) to something more descriptive\n",
    "- Save an appropriately-named PDF version of your slide deck to the repository\n",
    "- Rename the template readme you've been working in by running `git mv TEMPLATE_README.md README.md`\n",
    "- Delete unnecessary files from the repo using `git rm`\n",
    "   - The presentation PDF: `DS_Project_Presentation_Template.pdf`\n",
    "   - This README file: `README.md`\n",
    "   - Any unused data files in the `data` folder\n",
    "   - Any unused images in the `images` folder\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submit Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit your project, please follow the instructions in the [Project Submission & Review](https://learning.flatironschool.com/courses/1384/pages/project-submission-and-review-online?module_item_id=91641) page on Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- The visualizations in the notebook use best practices for visualization that you should try to emulate. For example, they have clear axes, descriptive titles, and appropriate number formatting.\n",
    "- The `dsc-phase1-project-template.ipynb` is intended to be the _final version_ of your project. The first notebook you create will not look like this. You are encouraged to start with a very disorderly notebook and clean it as you go.\n",
    "- If you would like to use SQL for this project, please open the `create_sql_database.ipynb` notebook, and run the cells. The schema for the database is stored in the images/ folder.\n"
